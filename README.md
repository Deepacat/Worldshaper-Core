The core pack mod for the Worldshaper modpack

Currently implements:
	Custom portals with create train support
Planned:
	custom multiblocks for the packs progression, 
	likely a replacement for GCyMs.
	custom bedrock miners if gtm doesn't fix them.
	potentially a cross dimension item transportation method using gt multiblocks if needed and doable
